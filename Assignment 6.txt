1) Write two different queries that would produce all orders taken on October 3rd or 
4th, 1990.
select * from orders where odate ='1990-10-03' or odate='1990-10-
04';
 select * from orders where odate ='90-10-03' or odate='90-10-04';

2) Write a query that selects all of the customers serviced by Peel or Motika.
(Hint: the snum field relates the two tables to one another).
 select * from customers where snum between 1001 and 1004 and snum
 != 1002;
