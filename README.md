## 🎯 Purpose  
This repository captures my **journey into database systems** — from fundamentals of relational databases to advanced SQL queries, optimization, and real-world data modeling.  
It serves as both a learning tool and a portfolio piece for recruiters & engineers to see my progression in data engineering and backend systems.

## 📚 What’s Inside  
- **Schema Design**: ER diagrams, normalized relational schemas for hypothetical business domains.  
- **SQL Scripts**: Data definition (CREATE), manipulation (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE), and complex retrieval (JOINs, subqueries, window functions).  
- **Database Engines**: Examples and scripts using SQL Server, Azure SQL, PostgreSQL (as applicable).  
- **Practice Exercises**: Real-world data scenarios, performance optimization tasks, indexing strategies.  
- **Mini Projects**: End-to-end mini-apps: database design → script execution → result analysis.
